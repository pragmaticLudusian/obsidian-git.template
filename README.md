# Obsidian-git vault template
This is a template that can be used to build an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault to clone, work and even sync using Vinzent's [obsidian-git](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git) community plugin.
This vault, basically being a folder, will then double as its own git repo - allowing for quick implementation through GitHub's templates interface.

## Implementation
Simply fork this repo and (optionally) make a [repo template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) out of it! Tweak the settings in the Obsidian app to suit your needs.

## Notes about syncing to GitHub
- All base Obsidian options are configured as default, but some config files will not be synced - particularly the Workspaces and Editor-specific settings that would become apparent between desktop and mobile apps.
- Inside the obsidian-git settings, some template values will need to be filled in - namely the hostname and author's username and email.
